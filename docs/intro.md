# Intro

Let's discover **wrapper-async in less than 10 minutes**.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind the development of this library is to address a wide range of common scenarios encountered when working with asynchronous functions.

These scenarios include tasks such as:

1. Caching data
2. Efficiently handling event debouncing
3. Gracefully managing the retrying of API calls

In addition to these essential features, the library also provides extensive functionality for meticulously **monitoring and tracking** each step of your asynchronous functions, ensuring greater transparency and control over their execution.

## Feature List

| Feature          | Purpose                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Cache            | Identical results for sameÂ params    |
| Event tracking   | Track activity on your promises      |
| Retry on failure | Rejected recalls the promises        |
| Debounce         | Last call in a specific time is used |
